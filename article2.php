<p>Just like many other countries, the United States should enforce gun control to save lives and reduce crime rates. Accidents and deaths could be avoided by enforcing gun control, which is why it is an important matter in our society today.</p>
<p>Many of the people against gun control, such as members of the NRA, point to the Second Amendment to defend their rights to keep and bear arms, which may seem valid. The Second Amendment of the United States’ Constitution was signed in 1789 and reads:
“A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the People to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.” (Constitution Center).
In no way does this quote support individuals keeping and bearing arms for self protection, however, it does give this right to a well-regulated militia. This is why the Second Amendment fails as an argument against enforcing gun control.</p>

<p>Dec. 30, 2014, seemed like any other day to 29-year old Veronica J. Rutledge as she headed to Walmart to shop with her 2-year-old son. Rutledge was carrying a concealed weapon, which she had the right to do with her concealed weapons permit. The day would be her last. While in the store, she left her son in the cart for a brief moment. He reached for her purse, found the gun, and accidentally shot his own mother (StarTribune, 2014). Several incidents such as this one have been reported throughout the years. Children find their parents’ guns and accidentally shoot themselves, friends or family. It is quite obvious that these kind of accidents could be avoided by not allowing people to keep and bear arms.</p>
<p>Another important point is the number of suicides, which could be decreased. In 2013, around 41,000 Americans committed suicide. Out of all of these people, around 21,000 used firearms (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). If it would have been harder for the suicide victims to get hold of a gun, they might still be alive. There is, of course, the possibility that they would have found another way to end their lives, but shooting themselves might have seemed a quick, painless escape compared to other options.</p>
<p>There will be problems even with gun control being enforced. “Bad guys” will always find a way to get guns, but by limiting their access, crime rates may decrease. It is true without guns, they would most likely find other ways to hurt or kill people, but it would not be as easy. With a gun, someone can be shot from a distance without any way to protect themselves. In December 2015, a 7-year-old boy was killed in a drive-by-shooting (Miami Herald, 2015). If these criminals had not had access to guns, this boy could still be alive.</p>
<p>To sum this up, the United States should enforce gun control as it could save lives and decrease crime rates. The Second Amendment does not give individuals the right to keep and bear arms, and is therefore an invalid argument for people against gun control.</p>
